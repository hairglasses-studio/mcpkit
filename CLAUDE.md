## Dependency Layers

- **Layer 1** (no internal deps): `registry`, `health`, `sanitize`, `secrets`, `client`
- **Layer 2** (depend on Layer 1): `resources`, `prompts`, `handler`, `resilience`, `mcptest`, `auth`, `observability`, `logging`, `sampling`, `roots`, `research`, `discovery`, `dispatcher`, `extensions`, `memory`, `finops`, `lifecycle`, `eval`, `roadmap`
- **Layer 3** (depend on Layer 2): `security`, `gateway`, `ralph`, `skills`, `a2a`, `rdcycle`
- **Layer 4** (depend on Layer 3): `orchestrator`, `handoff`, `workflow`, `bootstrap`

## Coding Conventions

- Middleware signature: `func(name string, td registry.ToolDefinition, next registry.ToolHandlerFunc) registry.ToolHandlerFunc`
- Error codes: `handler.CodedErrorResult(handler.ErrInvalidParam, err)` — codes defined in `handler/result.go`
- Param extraction: `handler.GetStringParam(req, "name")`, `handler.GetIntParam(req, "name", default)`
- Result builders: `handler.TextResult()`, `handler.JSONResult()`, `handler.ErrorResult()`, `handler.StructuredResult()`
- Thread safety: all registries use `sync.RWMutex` — `RLock` for reads, `Lock` for writes
- SDK compat: import MCP types through `registry/compat.go` aliases when building tool modules
- Dual-SDK: `//go:build !official_sdk` tags on mcp-go specific files; `//go:build official_sdk` for go-sdk variants
- Adapter functions: use `registry.MakeTextContent()`, `registry.MakeErrorResult()`, `registry.ExtractArguments()` instead of SDK-specific constructors

## Testing

- Test files: `*_test.go` in same package
- Use `mcptest.NewServer()` for integration tests, stdlib `testing` for unit tests
- Assertions: `mcptest/assert.go` helpers or stdlib `t.Errorf`/`t.Fatalf`
- Each package's tests must pass in isolation: `go test ./handler/ -count=1`

## Parallel Agent Rules

- **One agent per package** — don't edit files in another agent's package directory
- Import direction: lower layers never import upper layers (see Dependency Layers)
- Feature branches: each agent works on its own branch, merged after CI passes
- New package checklist: add CLAUDE.md if complex, ensure `_test.go` files exist, follow middleware signature if applicable
